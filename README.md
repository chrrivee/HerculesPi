# HERCULES - System Resource Monitor

A powerful system resource monitor built in Rust with a compact mode that resembles neofetch. Supports both Windows and Linux.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of system resources
- Detailed CPU usage statistics (overall and per-core)
- Memory usage tracking
- Disk usage information
- Network transfer rates
- Process monitoring
- Gyroscope and accelerometer monitoring via USB
- Beautiful compact display mode with Intel CPU ASCII art
- Cross-platform support (Windows and Linux)
- Fully functional CLI configuration system with persistent settings

## Installation

### Build from Source

Clone the repository and build with Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hercules.git
cd hercules
cargo build --release
````

The built executable will be available at `target/release/hercules`.

### Installer

You can also use the built-in installer:

#### Windows

```bash
hercules --installer
```

This will install Hercules to `C:\Program Files\hercules` and create a desktop shortcut.

#### Linux

```bash
sudo hercules --installer
```

This will install Hercules to `/usr/local/bin/hercules` and create a desktop entry.

## Usage

### Standard Mode

Run HERCULES in standard mode to see detailed system information:

```bash
hercules
```

Or if running from source:

```bash
cargo run
```

### Compact Mode

Run HERCULES in compact mode to see a neofetch-like display with Intel CPU ASCII art:

```bash
hercules compact
```

Or if running from source:

```bash
cargo run -- compact
```

The compact mode provides a visually appealing display with:

* Intel CPU ASCII art that changes color based on system load
* System information (OS, kernel, hostname)
* CPU information with usage bars
* Memory usage statistics
* Network transfer rates
* Individual CPU core usage displayed graphically

### Sensor Mode

Enable gyroscope and accelerometer monitoring:

```bash
hercules --sensors
```

Or if running from source:

```bash
cargo run -- --sensors
```

This mode will attempt to detect and read data from USB-connected gyroscopes and accelerometers.

### CLI Configuration System

Hercules includes a CLI-based configuration system for easy customization:

* View current configuration:

  ```bash
  hercules conf
  ```

* Change a setting:

  ```bash
  hercules conf <property> -> <value>
  ```

* Reset configuration to defaults:

  ```bash
  hercules conf-reset
  ```

## Configuration

Configuration is done through command-line arguments and CLI commands. More customization options will be available in future releases.

## Requirements

### Windows

* Rust 1.56.0 or higher
* Standard system libraries for retrieving system information
* Optional: USB-connected gyroscope/accelerometer for sensor monitoring

### Linux

* Rust 1.56.0 or higher
* `libudev-dev` package for USB device access
* `libusb-1.0-0-dev` for USB communication
* Optional: USB-connected gyroscope/accelerometer for sensor monitoring

On Debian/Ubuntu systems, install dependencies with:

```bash
sudo apt install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

On Fedora/RHEL systems:

```bash
sudo dnf install systemd-devel libusb1-devel
```

## Supported Sensor Devices

Hercules supports various USB-connected gyroscope and accelerometer devices, including:

* MPU-6050 based adapters
* Arduino Leonardo with IMU shields
* SparkFun 9DoF sensors
* Many gaming controllers with gyro (like DualShock 4, Nintendo Switch Pro)
* Other HID devices that identify as gyroscopes or accelerometers

## ✅ All Features Working

### ✅ Installer

* `hercules --installer` and `hercules installer` working perfectly

### ✅ Compact Mode with Sensors

* `hercules --compact` and `hercules compact`
* Displays sensor data integrated with the ASCII art

### ✅ Sensors

* `hercules --sensors` and `hercules sensors`
* Full sensor data display without errors

### ✅ CLI Configuration System

* `hercules conf` — shows current config
* `hercules conf <property> -> <value>` — change settings
* `hercules conf-reset` — resets to defaults
* Syntax with `->` arrow works as expected
